## Part 2: Hands-On Demos

Building an unstoppable, simple web dApp using popular web2 technologies. If you want to run the dApp locally, simply run `python app.py` in your terminal. You may need a couple dependencies that you can install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

The walkthrough that we went over in the workshop is in the `demos.ipynb`, with the step-by-step in markdown.

This web dApp pulls the latest Ethereum price using a decentralized RPC call ([dRPC](https://drpc.org/)) to a decentralized price feed ([Chainlink](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-price-feeds-secure-defi/)). It also allows the user to download and render an image of an NFT (that was used as a [POAP](https://poap.gallery/drops/185234) for this workshop) from the decentralized stoarge provider Storj.
